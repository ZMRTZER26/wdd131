			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>Streamers often play a variety of image based games from guess who to tierlists.
				This site will create one such game. A game of Guess Who with VTubers as the theme.
				An easy to use, easy to play game that comes with the ability to add new images into
				the game. </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience of this site will be live streamers, specifically VTubers, and their
				communities.
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>1. A function that spins through a list of images before stopping on one of the images.</p>
			<p>2. It will start with a basic start button that will activate the first function.</p>
			<p>3. After the first spin, the image that is stopped on will act as the button.</p>
			<p>4. An object that will hold all of the images.</p>
			<p>5. A JS file that will call the object and run the aformentioned functions.</p>
			<p>6. Functions that will take images added via form, add them to the object and random selection functions. </p>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c"
				target="_blank"

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>

						<td class="primary">[#396E94]</td>

					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: Chewy
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Rubic
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
				tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
				veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea

			<!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
			<nav>
				<a href="#">Home</a>
				<a href="#">Page2</a>
				<a href="#">Page3</a>
			</nav>
			<hr />

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>On click, will spin through a selection of images, stopping on a random image. If user is unable to guess the name, the hint button can be pressed to display the name.
				Clicking the image will start the process over again.
			</p>
			<p>
				If I get everything done with enough time, I'm thinking of trying to add functions that will remove chosen images from the randomized pool and a reset button to place
				all removed images back into the randomized pool.
			</p>
			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>
				I chose 10 Vtubers who I have worked with in the past and have taken images of those Vtubers, that I have used in past projects, to use as test images here.
			</p>
			<div class="gallery_images">
				<img src="./images/CaptainCube.png" alt="image 1">
				<img src="./images/vividlyVIVI.jpg" alt="image 2">
				<img src="./images/JarudeXSandstorm.jpg" alt="image 3">
				<img src="./images/M0YASI.png" alt="image 4">
				<img src="./images/HootyHoo.jpg" alt="image 5">
				<img src="./images/Shuumi.jpg" alt="image 6">
				<img src="./images/ProximalScrub.jpg" alt="image 7">
				<img src="./images/JeanFaymas.jpg" alt="image 8">
				<img src="./images/Junk.jpg" alt="image 9">
				<img src="./images/UWOSLAB.jpg" alt="image 10">
			</div>
			<h3>[Page 3]</h3>
			<p>
				A potential third page for uploading images to be added to the ranomized pool & gallery.
				Not entirely certain if I can get this page to work so it's currently of "if I have time" page.
			</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				Image at the center will be a "Start" button on page load. After the first spin, the image will become the button.
				Hint button will reveal the name of the Vtuber above the image.
				The button at the bottom will move user to 3rd page for adding an image.
			</p>
			<img src="./images/Home-page-wireframe.jpg" alt="Home Page Wireframe">

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>
				Gallery of all images used in the home page.
			</p>
			<img src="./images/Gallery-page-wireframe.jpg" alt="Image Gallery Page Wireframe">

			<h3>[Page 3]</h3>
			<p>
				Semi secret page.
				One button for uploading an image.
				Second button for adding the image (seperate button in case wrong file was chosen)
				Success or Error messages displayed below form box.
				I'm not certain if I know enough to get this page to work, hence why it's a semi secret page.
				If I get everything else done with time left over, I'll add this page. Otherwise, I'll stick to
				just the Home and Gallery pages.
